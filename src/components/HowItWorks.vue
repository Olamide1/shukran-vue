              <ul>
                <li>
                  As a creator in any space, when you open an account on Shukran, <b>we provide you with a unique tipping link.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your unique tipping link looks somewhat like this <a href="https://useshukran.com/cr/chuks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://useshukran.com/cr/chuks</a>.
                </li>

            <p class="uk-text-lead">How to see your link.</p>

            <img data-loading="/static/img/placeholder-image.png" data-src="/static/img/your tipping link on shukran.jfif" width="430px" height="286px" alt="how to login and signup on shukran" uk-img>

            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Click "Get tipped" from the navigation bar, and a pop up shows with your tipping link.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Please copy it if you need to and <b>PLUG YOUR LINK SHAMELESSLY</b> along with your content when you post them.
                </li>
              </ul>
                </p>

            <p class="uk-text-lead">What does your link show? What will your supporters see when they open the link? <br> What message does it tell your supporters?</p>

            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Your tipping link shows them what you do i.e your craft. So make your supporters know you and give you better
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your primary content link leads them to main source of your content.
                </li>
                <li>
                  So sell yourself (to your supporters, and just about everyone).
                </li>
                <li>
                  We implore you to open your link yourself and see what shows...
                </li>
                <li>
                  Are you okay with that? Is that what you want everyone else to see?
                </li>
                <li>
                  So <router-link to="/accounts">edit your profile</router-link> as often as needed. To fill these details on your dashboard, see the reference graphic above
